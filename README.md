A place for proposal submissions.

## Proposals

Please submit proposals as a PR to this repo adding the proposal documents under a folder with your Github user name.
(ie. user_a working on bip174 would make a folder called `project-proposals/bip174/user_a`)

Place whatever files you need in that folder, but please have a file called `PROPOSAL.md` that contains the main proposal in markdown.

Anything besides Markdown Text and images, like source code for examples should be in its own folder if needed.

## Merge = Accepted

I will decide to merge or not by May 7th.
